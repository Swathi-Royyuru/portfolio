  üë©‚Äçüíª I began my professional career in 2021 as a Backend Java Developer at Capgemini Technology Services Ltd., Bengaluru. Over the course of two years, I contributed to the development and maintenance of enterprise-grade software solutions for global clients, including Siemens Healthineers and Mercedes Benz R&D. <br><br>

  üìñ In 2024, I embarked on a new academic path by pursuing Master‚Äôs in Information Systems at Saint Louis University (SLU), with a strong focus on bridging technology and business strategy. My academic journey is enriching my understanding of key areas such as data analytics, cybersecurity, enterprise systems, web development and project management. Outside the classroom, I actively engage in university-led tech events, career development workshops, and innovation challenges.<br><br>

  üí° I‚Äôm passionate about using technology to drive efficiency, solve meaningful problems, and create real-world impact. Whether it's optimizing backend processes or analyzing business needs, I aim to build solutions that are both technically sound and user-centric.<br><br>
